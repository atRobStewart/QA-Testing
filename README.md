# QA-Testing

This website will document all the bugs and glitches I find in games. It will contain screenshots and videos along with a description of the issue. 
Additionally, I will do my best to diagnose the problem accurately and apply practices seen in bug tracking, documenting and triaging. 

Not having access to game log files and tools that would allow me to pause, rewind and apply inputs on desired frames will be challenging but will make successful diagnosis all the more rewarding.

Game updates will present an opportunity to perform regression testing but this will likely only be available in the early days of release and on titles with multiplayer like Halo and Call of Duty.
